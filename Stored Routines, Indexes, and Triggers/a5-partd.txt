A5 Part D: Procedural SQL Applications in the Final Project
Collaboration: (Optional, include student names and emails)
Final Project Topic: Tinder For Athletes

Part D Answers:
UDF(s): get_age(d DATE) RETURNS INT DETERMINISTIC
  This fucntion will take in the user's birthday and calculate 
  their age. This will be helpful when trying to match athletes with 
  those closer to their demographic. This would also help us manage
  who can access the app as we want to incorporate an age limit of 18.

Procedure(s): update_email(user_ID CHAR, new_email VARCHAR)
  This will be useful for when users want to update their emails
  as they need to sign in each time with their email. Therefore, if
  they forget their email or lose their email, they can update it. 
  Also, can be useful when users delete their account.

* Trigger(s): hash_and_store BEFORE INSERT
  I was thinking that before we insert a new user, we can hash their 
  password to improve security and then store the hashed password instead 
  of the user defined password.
